# convLSTM-autoencoder
Prototype for a convolutional LSTM autoencoder.
Release notes:
- Can read a jpeg image and resize it for input to the network.
- Have modified code to make sure tensor dimensions in the model match. Have checked using print statements.
- Will know add TensorBoard calls create a visual of the unrolled model graph.
